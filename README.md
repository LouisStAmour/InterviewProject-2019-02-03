Based on React Webpack Typescript Starter, as documented below. See `redux/`
folder for Redux components written and type-checked using TypeScript, and
`components/` for the app's components (currently with hardcoded data saved to
`tests/__fixtures__`)

Rename `default.env` to `.env` then update it with the API key and API hostname
to use, run `yarn start` and visit http://localhost:8080/
